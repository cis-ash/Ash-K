<li>implementing feedback for player actions</li>
<li>prototyping</li>
<li>game design</li>
<li>project management</li>

early prototype of the initial idea</p>

<p>after creating a pretty and polished version of our initial idea and gathering some feedback from the players we found out that many found it to be confusing to shoot and keep track of different types of clothes, could not see their selected ammo at a glance and were bored by the game only requiring them to aim and switch clothes.</p>
<p>In our second version we addressed all of these issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Made enemies request 2 items, each being of 1/4 colours</li>
<li>removed the pants-shirt separation</li>
<li>moved ammo type display to be on the player and around the border of the screen</li>
<li>added ammo pickups and flying hazards to keep players on the move</li>
<li>added recoil to make standing still impossible</li>
<li>added a health bar that allows player to fail 3 times</li>
</ul>
